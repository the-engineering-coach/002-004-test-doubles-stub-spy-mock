# Test Doubles Explained: A Complete Guide for TDD in PHP

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube series on Test Doubles.

In this series, we explore the four main types of Test Doublesâ€”Stubs, Spies, Mocks, and Fakesâ€”and demonstrate how to use them with Test-Driven Development (TDD) in PHP using the PHPUnit framework.
